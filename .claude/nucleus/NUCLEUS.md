# 🧠 Context Nucleus

> The single source of truth for everything you're doing with Claude — across
> chats, Cowork, code, and design. Any surface hands off context **to** this
> file; every new session reads context **from** it. If a fresh Claude doesn't
> have your context, it's because it hasn't read this yet — so it always does.

## 📌 North Star
_What we're ultimately building and why. Edit this by hand — it changes rarely._

- **Project:** DubaiAI.pro — marketing site for a Dubai-based AI consultancy
  ("Bespoke AI Implementation & Audit").
- **What they sell:** Full-stack AI engineering across three layers —
  Layer 1 (AI Infrastructure), Layer 2 (AI Applications), Layer 3 (Agentic AI) —
  plus regulatory-grade AI auditing, for enterprises and government.
- **Goal:** A premium, high-trust landing page that converts enterprise/gov
  leads into a contact (`hello@dubaiai.pro`). Live at https://dubaiai.pro.

## 🎯 Active Threads
_What's in flight right now. The 1–5 things a new session should care about._

- [ ] Context Nucleus system is built (hooks + CLI + web bridge) — PR #10 open
      on `claude/epic-einstein-jPNIL`, not yet merged to `main`.
- [ ] Wire the nucleus widget into the local app at http://localhost:3001/.
- [ ] (add the next real landing-page task here)

## 🧩 Decisions & Conventions
_Choices already made, so no surface re-litigates them._

- **Single-file site:** everything lives in `index.html` (inline CSS/JS), no
  build step. Hosted on GitHub Pages via `CNAME` → dubaiai.pro.
- **Brand palette:** gold `#c8a45c` (accent), navy `#0a1628` (text/dark),
  cream/sand backgrounds (`#faf8f3`, `#f5f0e6`, `#e8e0d0`).
- **Type:** DM Serif Display (headings), Inter (body), JetBrains Mono (mono).
- **Sections / nav anchors:** hero, about, services, audit, process, cases,
  contact.
- **Contact:** `hello@dubaiai.pro`.

## 📥 Handoffs
_Newest first. Written automatically by hooks and by `nucleus push` from any
surface. This is the message-in-a-bottle between sessions._
